SUMMARY

I'm very passionate about technology. I really like solving complex technical
problems.

My career began as a processor designer. I got some patents, for example on
high speed cell reading circuit, to tackle challenging problems.

And also, I studied UNIX deep level and published a UNIX kernel text used
in some college OS courses.

Some years ago, I came to the US to take a new challenge. I've been working on
In-memory database with chip-level optimization.

More recently, I'm really excited to work on Web 3DCG because it's a very hot
and new challenging technology. I've been contributing to Three.js project in
my freetime for a year and am one of key contributors, top 10% over 100
contributors, now. 

And also I've been working on A-Frame as one of core developers to extend Web
3DCG potential to VR. I had a talk at A-Frame official meetup.

EXPERIENCE

Senior software engineer
Fujitsu Technology and Business of America, Inc. 2/2013 to Present

Working on the In-Memory database project which enables fast big data analyze
with Oracle.

Developed Fujitsu M10 server specific library for Oracle In-Memory Database
which made the use of M10 processor SWoC(Software on Chip) especially SIMD and
achieved 100x better OLAP performance compared to the traditional database.
