Open source:
- Three.js: Top 10 contributor out of 800 contributors
  Three.js is the most widely-used JavaScript graphics library.
  Contributed ((*)Independently)
  - loaders: MMD(*), glTF, FBX, binary parser for MMD and FBX(*)
  - Cartoon: Toon Material(*), Outline Effect(*)

- A-Frame VR: Collaborator and core contributor
  A-Frame is a web framework for creating WebVR content.
  Released many components
  - Rain effect: draws over 5000 rain drops with good performance by using 
                 hardware instancing technique.
  - MMD loader: loads MMD data and plays audio-sync animation with physics
  - Outline effect: draws outline with face culling technique
  - Deferred Rendering: renders many lights with good performance.
  Had demo presentations at A-Frame meetup.

- Three.js MMDLoader sample applications: Author
  WebVR, Music live, Face tracking, HTML5 Speech Synthesis, Physics simulation,
  Interactive, Post processing with GLSL, Water simulation with GPU, and so on.
