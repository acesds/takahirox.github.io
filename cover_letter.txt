Dear HR Manager:

I'm very interested in your [position-name] position.

I am a WebGL/WebVR/Three.js/A-Frame software engineer. I've been contributing to
Three.js and A-Frame projects as one of key developers. I am top 10 contributor
of Three.js and have collaborator permission level of A-Frame now. Refer to my
portfolio for my works.

I have strong JavaScript/C/C++ skills, especially performance tuning. On my
current job with Oracle Database team, we've achieved 100x performance with
chip-level tuning.

I really like solving difficult challenging problems, studying new things, and
learning from each other. I got five patents to solve the problems on the job.
And I published OS kernel source code text used in some college courses.

I'm very looking forward to talking with you.
